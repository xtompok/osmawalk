Walking in the city is a part of everyday life for many people. Finding the right
way is not very easy. From the data of OpenStreetMap project we made data
structures suitable for finding paths for pedesterians, including direct walking through
areas (parks, squares). Fixing some bugs in input data is also a part of the
thesis. We have made an application for finding pedesterian ways and their export
to GPX as well.
